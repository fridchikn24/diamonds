## Project Overview

Diamonds are evaluated based on various attributes such as carat, cut, color, and clarity. This project aims to:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights about the dataset.
- Build predictive models to estimate diamond prices based on their attributes.
- Provide visualizations to aid in understanding the relationships between different features and the price.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about diamonds, including:

- **Carat**: The weight of the diamond.
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut (e.g., Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- **Color**: Diamond color, with categories ranging from D (best) to J (worst).
- **Clarity**: A measurement of how clear the diamond is (e.g., I1, SI1, SI2, VS1, VS2, VVS1, VVS2, IF).
- **Depth**: Total depth percentage.
- **Table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point.
- **Price**: Price in US dollars.
- **X**: Length in mm.
- **Y**: Width in mm.
- **Z**: Depth in mm.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fridchikn24/diamonds.git
   cd diamonds

2. **Install dependencies:**

Ensure you have Poetry installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   poetry install

This command will create a virtual environment and install all required dependencies as specified in pyproject.toml.
